## 🚀 Creating a Project

If you're reading this, you've probably already completed this step. Congrats! 🎉

```bash
# create a new project in the current directory
bun create sv

# create a new project in the my-app directory
bun create sv my-app
```

## 💻 Developing

Once your project is set up and dependencies installed with `bun install`, start an ultra-fast development server:

```bash
bun dev

# or open directly in your browser
bun dev --open
```

💡 **Tip:** Bun is so fast, you might not even notice the build time! ⚡

## 🏗️ Build & Preview

Prepare your app for production with top-notch optimizations:

```bash
bun run build
```

Then preview your build with:

```bash
bun run preview
```

> To deploy your app, you might need an [adapter](https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/adapters) depending on your target environment.
